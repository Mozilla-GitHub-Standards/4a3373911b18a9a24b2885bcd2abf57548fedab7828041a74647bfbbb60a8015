Website Lifecycle
===============

Websites at Mozilla generally share this lifecycle:

1. Ideation
2. Resourcing
3. Design & Build
4. Learn & Iterate
5. Decommission

Your site may not have all of these and if you are building a service, there
may not be a step 5 for many years. Additionally for a campaign website, there
maybe a very short step 4.
